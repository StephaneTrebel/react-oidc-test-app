= About

This repository is an extension of the example proof-of-concept located at https://github.com/authts/react-oidc-context/tree/main/example.

It is meant to be used in conjunction with an OIDC capable identity provider. In my demonstration I used the https://docs.goauthentik.io/docs/installation/docker-compose[Authentik basic starter docker-compose].

Feel free to use it as you see fit ! ðŸ˜‰
