This folder host the docker-compose file I used to start an Authentik instance.

= How to use

Simply create a `.env` file having the required `PG_PASS` and `AUTHENTIK_SECRET_KEY` variables, as documented by Authentik:

```bash
echo "PG_PASS=$(openssl rand -base64 36 | tr -d '\n')" >> .env
echo "AUTHENTIK_SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 60 | tr -d '\n')" >> .env
```

and then it's straightforward:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Authentik will be available at http://localhost:9000

NOTE: I recommend that you use a different browser profile for Authentik admin session, in order to mix up your session with a test user session with the sample app ðŸ˜‰
