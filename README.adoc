= About

This repository is an extension of the example proof-of-concept located at https://github.com/authts/react-oidc-context/tree/main/example.

It is meant to be used in conjunction with an OIDC capable identity provider. In my demonstration I used the https://docs.goauthentik.io/docs/installation/docker-compose[Authentik basic starter docker-compose].
For easy reproducibility, I've included the docker-compose I used in `./authentik`.

Feel free to use it as you see fit ! üòâ

= Requirements

- Docker and docker-compose

= How to use

1. Create a `.env` file having the required `PG_PASS` and `AUTHENTIK_SECRET_KEY` variables, as documented by Authentik:

[source, bash]
----
$ echo "PG_PASS=$(openssl rand -base64 36 | tr -d '\n')" >> .env
$ echo "AUTHENTIK_SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 60 | tr -d '\n')" >> .env
----

2. Run this to add `keycloak` as a valid FQDN for `localhost`. Authentik need to communicate with Keycloak in the docker network (thus through `keycloak` FQDN), but in doing so the redirect address will be `keycloak` for login. That's why we need this kinda hack:

[source, bash]
----
$ echo "127.0.0.1 keycloak" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
----

3. Now go into the `./docker` directory and run

[source, bash]
----
$ docker compose pull
$ docker compose up -d
----

Then you will have access to the following services:
- `http://localhost:1234` is the React WebApp
- `http://localhost:9000` is the Authentik instance
- `http://localhost:8080` is the Keycloak instance (admittedly you can now also use `http://keycloak:8080` but it's not required for administration purposes)

The connexions are as follows:
- The WebApp is declared as a `my-app` client in Authentik, with a dedicated `Provider for my-app` OIDC provider.
- Authentik uses `Keycloak OIDC` as a "Federated Social Login" option through a client `authentik-login` created in the `my-realm` Keycloak realm.
- A user `my-user` with password `my-password` is created in Keycloak. It belongs to the `my-users` Keycloak group.

Thus you can test the whole workflow by going to the webapp, clicking on Log In, selecting `Keycloak OIDC` and using the aforementionned credentials for `my-user` to be logged as `my-user` on the webapp.

NOTE: I recommend that you use a different browser profile for Authentik admin session, in order to mix up your administrator session with a test user session with the sample app üòâ

And...that's it ! üòÅ
